abstract = "It is a major task to develop effective strategies for defending the power system against deliberate attacks. It is critical to comprehensively consider the human-related and environmental risks and uncertainties, which is missing in existing literature. This paper considers the load demand uncertainties and wind generation uncertainties in addition to the interactive attacker/defender behaviors. Specifically, a defender-attacker-nature-operator model is proposed, which incorporates the attack/defense interaction, the corrective re-dispatch of the operator, the coordination between the attack strategy and the stochastic nature of load demands and wind generations. The Column-and-Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm is adopted for solving the proposed model by decomposing the proposed model into a master problem and a sub-problem. Simulations are performed using MATLAB and CPLEX on a modified IEEE RTS79 system. The simulation results verify the validity of the proposed model."
